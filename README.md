  The Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid
  is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.
  RULES: Each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 
  1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once 
  in a row, column or box.
  The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
  or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, 
  must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.
  Every puzzle has just one correct solution.

# Tools used -
